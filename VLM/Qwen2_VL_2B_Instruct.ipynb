    "## Qwen2-VL vs Qwen2-VL-Instruct\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference is that Qwen2-VL-Instruct is an instruction-following version of the foundational Qwen2-VL model. \n",
    "Qwen2-VL is the base, multimodal large language model with enhancements like dynamic resolution and advanced video processing capabilities, \n",
    "while Qwen2-VL-Instruct is the fine-tuned version specifically trained to respond to user instructions and questions in a conversational, task-oriented manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Qwen2-VL (Base Model)\n",
    "- Foundation: \n",
    "    - The core multimodal model that understands both text and visual information. \n",
    "- Advanced Vision: \n",
    "    - Features significant improvements in vision, including the ability to process images of any resolution (naive dynamic resolution) and to understand long videos (over 20 minutes). \n",
    "- Agent Functionality: \n",
    "    - Designed to serve as a versatile visual agent capable of complex reasoning, decision-making, and operating devices. \n",
    "- Language Capabilities: \n",
    "    - Maintains the strong linguistic foundation of the Qwen2 LLM series. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Qwen2-VL-Instruct\n",
    "- Instruction Following: \n",
    "    - This is the version you would use to ask questions about images or videos and get direct answers. \n",
    "- Fine-tuned for Tasks: \n",
    "    - It has undergone instruction tuning, which is a process of training the base model to follow commands and generate helpful, relevant responses to instructions. \n",
    "- Conversational Interaction: \n",
    "    - Ideal for applications requiring dialogue and direct task execution, such as visual question answering or content creation from visual input. \n",
    "- Example Use Cases: \n",
    "    - You would use Qwen2-VL-Instruct to ask \"What is happening in this picture?\" or \"Summarize this video\". \n",
    "\n",
    "### In Summary\n",
    "Think of Qwen2-VL as the powerful engine and Qwen2-VL-Instruct as the user-friendly dashboard designed for interaction. \n",
