# 3DGS vs 3DGS mcmc vs 2DGS

3DGS, 3DGS-MCMC, and 2DGS are all techniques for generating photorealistic 3D scenes from multi-view images, but they differ fundamentally in their approach to representing and optimizing the scene's geometry.

## Summary of key differences

- **3DGS vs. 2DGS**: The primary difference lies in the Gaussian primitive used. 3DGS uses volumetric 3D Gaussians that excel at high-speed rendering but can struggle with precise surface geometry. In contrast, 2DGS uses flat, oriented 2D Gaussians to specifically target and accurately reconstruct object surfaces, resulting in higher geometric fidelity.
- **3DGS vs. 3DGS-MCMC**: The distinction is in the optimization method. Standard 3DGS relies on heuristic-based adaptive density control, which can be sensitive to initialization and lead to artifacts. 3DGS-MCMC replaces these heuristics with a mathematically principled Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling framework, leading to more robust training and better final results, albeit with a potentially longer training time.
- **3DGS-MCMC vs. 2DGS**: These represent two different approaches to improving upon standard 3DGS. 3DGS-MCMC enhances the *optimization process* for 3D Gaussians, while 2DGS replaces the *underlying representation* with 2D primitives. 3DGS-MCMC produces a more robust volumetric representation, while 2DGS provides superior geometric accuracy for surfaces.
